# Dynamic Country Explorer: Exploring World Regions with jQuery and AJAX

## Overview
The Dynamic Country Explorer is a single dynamic web page designed to allow users to explore various regions of the world and retrieve detailed information about countries within those regions. The project utilizes jQuery and AJAX to enhance interactivity and retrieve data from a provided API.

## Features
- **Region Selection:** Users can select a region from a dropdown menu populated with data fetched from the API.
- **Country Details Display:** Upon selecting a region, the web page dynamically displays detailed information about each country in that region in an HTML table. Information includes country code, flag, name, capital, population, area, and population density.
- **Region Summary:** The web page also provides a summary of the selected region, including the total number of countries, the name of the largest country, and the name of the most populated country.
- **Search Functionality:** Users can search for specific countries or capitals within the selected region using a search input textbox. The table dynamically updates to display only matching results, ignoring case sensitivity.

2. Open the `xyz.html` file in a web browser.
